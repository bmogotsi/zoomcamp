## Terraform
	What is a Terraform used for?
		Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services 
		through their application programming interfaces (APIs). 
		Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.
	
	HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources 
	in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. 
	You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. 
	Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, 
	and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
